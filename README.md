# DatabaseBackend

This backend program, based on Springboot and Mybatis-Plus, provides database access services for the [Frontend](https://github.com/SofiaCabello/DatabaseFrontend).
It is my course project of the DB course of the 2023 Spring Semester of [ZZU](https://www.zzu.edu.cn/).

This project is developed with IntelliJ IDEA. Its running depends on the existence of Springboot and a MySQL database. Please make sure that you have all the necessary environments prepared before running this project.
